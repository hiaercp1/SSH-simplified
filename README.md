## Intro
SSH, or Secure Shell, is a network protocol that allows you to securely access and manage remote servers and devices over an encrypted connection. It provides a secure way to communicate with your server, transfer files, and execute commands remotely. Learning how to use SSH can greatly increase your productivity and efficiency as a developer or system administrator. It eliminates the need to physically be in front of a server to perform tasks, and also ensures that your communications and data remain secure from prying eyes.
So, if you're ready to take your remote server management skills to the next level, buckle up and get ready to dive into the world of SSH!

## Structure of the **SSH** protocol:
### **üß¨SSH packet structureüß¨**
- #### _Package length_
size: 4 bytes
purpose: This specifies the total length of the packet, including the length of the packet length field itself. It is usually 32 bits in size.
- #### _Padding amount_
size: 1 byte
purpose: This field is used to pad the packet to a specified block size for encryption. It is usually 8 bits in size.
- #### _Payload_
size: depends
purpose: This contains the actual data being transmitted, such as a command or file transfer. The size of the payload can vary depending on the specific data being sent.
- #### _Padding_
purpose: This padding is added to the payload to ensure that the total length of the packet is a multiple of the encryption block size. It is typically filled with random data and is used to prevent   padding oracle attacks.
- #### _MAC (Message Authentication Code)_
size: depends on the encryption algorithm used
purpose: The MAC field contains a cryptographic hash that is used to verify the integrity of the packet. By checking the MAC, the recipient can ascertain that the packet has not been tampered with during transmission.

## How to install **SSH**:
Usually SSH is installed on most Linux distributions by default and you can enable and use it right away, but if you're not sure if this is you're case, you can always check if it's installed by running the following command to check the version of SSH.
```sh
ssh -V
```
If you are in the rare situation when you don't have SSH installed by default, you can run the following commands to install it.
### Debian based distributions:
```sh
sudo apt install openssh-client
```
```sh
sudo apt isntall openssh-server
```
### RHEL:
```sh
sudo dnf install openssh
```
```sh
sudo dnf install openssh-server
```
### Arch based distributions:
```sh
sudo pacman -S openssh
```
## Enabling **SSH**:
In order to enable SSH we need to execute some simple commands depending on the system you are using as a backend for your Linux distribution. You might be running on an older Unix System V system or the newer SystemD based system.

### System V:

```sh
sudo service sshd start
```
### SystemD:

```sh
sudo systemctl start sshd
```
Once you exeute the right command for your's Linux system, **_Congratulations!_** you just started a SSH service. This is all fine but there is one problem, it is not persistent, that means that if you reboot your computer it will be disabled. To make it persistent you need to execute one more command.

### System V:

```sh
sudo chkconfig sshd on
```

### SystemD:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable sshd
```
Now SSH should be up and running. In the next section we will discover ways to make it more secure.

## **SSH** with certificates:

One of the ways to secure our SSH is by impoving the way we authenticate to the server. By now we were using a pair of _username_ and _password_, but passwords can be guessed, keylogged and brute-forced. In order to mitigate this risk we can use **certificates**.

First of all we need to.
